- 👋 Hi, I’m @joegruff16
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a successful full stack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about how to become a full stack developer within UCFs Coding Bootcamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects that I can include in my portfolio and to help others build their portfolio too!
- 📫 How to reach me: via my email: joegruff16@gmail.com or linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-ruff-gary0316/.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love coffee and especailly studying at coffee shops. It's my dream to one day become a freelancer where I would get to work fulltime from random coffee shops.
